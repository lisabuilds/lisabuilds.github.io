                <p>I'm an AI Engineer working toward specializing in LLMs and RL. Currently, I work on building distributed autonomous agents systems at Travelers. Previously, I founded NearMeNow, where I led a team of engineers in developing a real-time, scalable web app to connect people with their nearby social activities.</p>
                
                <p>What am I doing when I'm free? I like to spend time experimenting new tech advances in LLM fields. I currently play around setting up RL environment to try a few techniques for rewarding shaping.</p>

                <p>I'm particularly passionate about AI interpretablity, distributed training, and Reinforcement Learning With Human Feedback in the loop.
